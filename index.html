		<!-- My Background -->
		<h2>My Background</h2>
		<p>
			During my Undergrad at the University of Oregon, I was gradually exposed
			to Computer Science. <br />
			At the time, I was pursuing my degree in Accounting.
			<br />
			<br />
			It seemed to me that with Computer Science you could do Accounting better,
			faster, and cheaper.
			<br />
			<br />

			Since then, I've used my knowledge in Computer Science to automate the
			payment of tens of millions of dollars of tax payments on a portfolio of
			$2.5 billion for Great Ajax Mortgage (NYSE: AJX).

			<br />
			<br />
			In total, the time to pay each mortgage bill was reduced by 97% from 8
			minutes/loan to 14 seconds/loan.
		</p>

		<!-- My Current Interests -->
		<h2>My Current Interests</h2>
		<p>
			My main interest is being a part of the future of the automation of
			Accounting & Finance!
